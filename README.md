# School_Performance_Prediction
### Project 

The goal of the project is to design an application to predict the performance ratio of students in Math in a specific charter school in New York City. The application predicts the percentage of students that would fall into each of the performance standards - Meeting Standards, Partially Meeting Standards, and Not Meeting Standards.
